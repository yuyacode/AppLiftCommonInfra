Description: >
  This CloudFormation template defines shared network infrastructure resources, such as VPCs, subnets, and ALBs, that are commonly used across multiple components of a single application.
  Each component may be developed and deployed independently using different technologies, but they all rely on this foundational network layer.
  These resources are intentionally designed to be independent from any single component or technology, serving as a common infrastructure for the application's overall architecture.

      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      InstanceTenancy: default
